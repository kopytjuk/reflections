Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: 	Fork: A copy of an foreign repo to own github account (github feature)
	Clone: A repa copy from a location (github, local) to a machine with write rights.
	Branch: New commit id. I would use it in order to introduce new features or experiments in my own repo.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: You can have full access to the repo even being offline.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: Push a branch with changes and inform the maintainer to review the new feature - he decides whether to merge or not. It is harder to track different requests.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: If I did a pull request (from a remote-branch to remote-master) and after this time there was a change in remote master I have to incorporate the changes to the remote-branch to have the pull request up to date.
