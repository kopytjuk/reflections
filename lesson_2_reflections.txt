Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Git creates a new hidden directory .git and stores there the meta-data for all files in the current repo. We have to do it to let Git know which directory to track.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Only changes which are assigned to the staging area will be the content of the commit. You can make a lot of differences in the code base and incrementally stage and commit logical parts of the code.
